# RunescapeEquipment
This allows you to add equipment and see the combined stats of equipped gear.
By webscraping the Wikipedia for the game Oldschool Runescape information on the specified equipment is imported and stored.
In the GUI you can then select equipment from the appropriate drop down boxes and see the combined stats your character would have.
You can also import new gear in the GUI by typing the item name and clicking the import button.
This feasibly could import any and all equipment on the Wiki.
There's no functionality for unique weapon attributes like the osmumten's fang or Tumeken's shadow unfortunately.
